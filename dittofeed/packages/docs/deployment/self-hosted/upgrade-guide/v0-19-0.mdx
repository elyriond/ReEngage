Upgrading from v0.18.1 to v0.19.0 is straightforward, and only requires updating your dittofeed image tag.

## Update Your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` File

Update the `image` tag in your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file to `v0.19.0`:

```yaml
services:
  lite:
    image: dittofeed/dittofeed-lite:${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.19.0}
```

## Update Your Helm Chart

Update the `tag` in your `values.yaml` file to `v0.19.0`:

```yaml values.yaml
image:
  tag: ${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.19.0}
```

Upgrade the dittofeed chart:

```bash
helm upgrade --install dittofeed ./dittofeed/helm-charts/dittofeed
```
