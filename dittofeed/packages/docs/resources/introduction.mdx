Dittofeed [workspaces](/resources/workspaces) are configured with resources. These resources describe who gets messaged ([segments](/resources/segments)), when they get messaged ([journeys](/resources/journeys)), and what they get messaged with ([message templates](/resources/message-templates)).

The basic building block of user messaging in Dittofeed is a customer Journey. So let's jump right in!
