description: Compose users into groups.

Groups represent a collection of users, that are themselves represented as users, and which can have their own traits, and perform actions.

In contrast to [segments](/resources/segments), group ids are fully dynamic. So for example, a user can be assigned to a group, "group-123" without defining any resources in advance.

## Assigning Users to a Group

Users can be assigned to a group by submitting a Group event using the [Group endpoint](/api-reference/auto/public-apps/post-apipublicappsgroup).

```json POST /api/public/apps/group
{
  "userId": "user-123",
  "groupId": "group-456"
}
```

Note that groups are themselves users, and can have their own traits, and perform actions.

<Warning>
  Because groups are themselves users, its important to ensure that group ids and standard user ids don't clash. This is a risk for teams which are using auto-incrementing integer ids.

  To address this, we recommend using a prefix for group ids. For example, "group-123" instead of "123".
</Warning>

You can assign traits to a group, with the group endpoint.

```json POST /api/public/apps/group
{
  "userId": "user-123",
  "groupId": "group-456",
  "traits": {
    "name": "Class of 2025"
  }
}
```

Moreover, because groups are themselves users, you can also perform actions as a group.

```json POST /api/public/apps/track
{
  "userId": "group-456",
  "event": "ACTIVATE",
  "properties": {
    "plan": "pro"
  }
}
```

## Unassigning Users from a Group

To unassign a user from a group, you can use the `assign` flag and set it to `false`.

```json POST /api/public/apps/group
{
  "userId": "user-123",
  "groupId": "group-456",
  "assign": false
}
```

## Retrieval

You can retrieve groups for a user with the [`/groups/user-groups` endpoint](/api-reference/auto/groups/get-apiadmingroupsuser-groups).

You can also retrieve all users for a group with the [`/groups/users` endpoint](/api-reference/auto/groups/get-apiadmingroupsusers).


## Examples

### Parents and Children

Imagine you're running a school. Your users in Dittofeed are the parents whose contacts you've imported.

Parents share children between them. So for example, John and Jane are both parents of Sam.

You can represent this in Dittofeed by creating a group for Sam, and then adding John and Jane as members.

```json POST /api/public/apps/group
{
  "userId": "user-john-123",
  "groupId": "group-sam-456"
}
```

```json POST /api/public/apps/group
{
  "userId": "user-jane-456",
  "groupId": "group-sam-456"
}
```

Now, you can retrieve all users for Sam's group with the [`/groups/users` endpoint](/api-reference/auto/groups/get-apiadmingroupsusers).

```json GET /api/admin/groups/users
{
  "groupId": "group-sam-456"
}
```
