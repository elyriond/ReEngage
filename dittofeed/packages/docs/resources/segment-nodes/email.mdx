Email segments are used to segment on the outcome of a particular email. For example, you may want to segment on users who have opened an email, or users who have clicked a link in an email.

Email events which can be segmented upon include:

- Email Opened
- Email Clicked
- Email Bounced
- Email Delivered
- Email Marked as Spam
- Email Dropped
- Email Sent
