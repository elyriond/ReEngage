The dittofeed-ee application is a closed-source extension of Dittofeed that includes additional features, like support for multi-tenancy.

## Multi-tenancy

Multi-tenancy, facilitated by the `multi-tenant` "auth mode", allows you to run multiple Dittofeed workspaces on a single instance of Dittofeed. Workspaces allow you to isolate data for different customers, and can be managed programmatically.

To learn more about setting up the multi-tenant auth mode, see the [multi-tenant auth mode guide](/deployment/self-hosted/auth-modes/multi-tenant).

## Installation

For instructions on installing dittofeed-ee, see the [dittofeed-ee installation guide](/deployment/self-hosted/dittofeed-ee).
