## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

```bash
# Always create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes, commit regularly
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create Pull Request on GitHub
```

### Team Branches

- `main` - Protected, deployed to shared instance
- `feature/kafka-integration` - Kafka consumer service
- `feature/product-feed` - Product catalog management
- `feature/recommendations` - Recommendation engine
- `feature/ui-redesign` - Dashboard restyling
- `feature/templates` - Email templates & automations

---

## Working on Different Components

```bash
cd dittofeed/packages/dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend (API/Services)
```bash
cd dittofeed/packages/api
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Custom Packages (Mapp Fashion Extensions)

## Shared Demo Instance (Railway)

### Why Railway?
- ‚úÖ $5 free credit (enough for hackathon)
- ‚úÖ Auto-deploy from Git (team sees changes instantly)
- ‚úÖ No cold starts
- ‚úÖ Easy rollback

### Setup (Team Lead Only)

1. **Install Railway CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login to Railway**
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Initialize Project**
   ```bash
   cd dittofeed
   railway init
   # Choose: "Create new project"
   # Name: mapp-fashion
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

5. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   railway variables set PASSWORD=<strong-password>
   railway variables set WORKSPACE_NAME=MappFashion
   ```

6. **Get Public URL**
   ```bash
   railway domain
   # Creates: mapp-fashion-production.up.railway.app
   ```

7. **Share with Team**
   - Add team members in Railway dashboard
   - Share URL and credentials

### Access Shared Instance

**URL**: `https://mapp-fashion-production.up.railway.app` (or similar)

**Purpose**:
- Demo to judges/stakeholders
- Integration testing
- End-to-end testing with real data

**Credentials**:
- Password: `<team-lead-provides>`
- Workspace: `MappFashion`

**When to use**:
- Testing full flow with Kafka
- Showing progress to team
- Final demo preparation

### Auto-Deploy from Git

Once Railway is connected to your GitHub repo:
```bash
# Any push to main automatically deploys
git push origin main

# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs
```

---

## Common Commands

### Docker Management

```bash
# Stop all containers (data persists)
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml down

# Start containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up -d

# View logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml logs -f

# Restart a specific service
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml restart lite

# Fresh start (‚ö†Ô∏è deletes all data)
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml down -v
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up -d
```

### Database Access

```bash
# PostgreSQL
docker exec -it dittofeed-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d dittofeed

# ClickHouse
docker exec -it dittofeed-clickhouse-server-1 clickhouse-client
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Check what's using port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Stop the process or change port in docker-compose.yaml
```

### Docker Not Starting
```bash
# Restart Docker Desktop
# Wait 2 minutes, then retry
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up -d
```

### Changes Not Reflecting
```bash
# Rebuild containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up -d --build

# Or restart specific service
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml restart lite
```

### Database Issues
```bash
# Reset database (‚ö†Ô∏è deletes data)
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml down -v
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up -d
```
